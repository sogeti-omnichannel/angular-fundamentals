## Requirements
### JavaScript and HTML knowledge
Basic JavaScript and HTML knowledge is mandatory. Even better: good JavaScript knowledge will ease the steep learning curve of Angular. For example: knowledge of HTML form validation will make it easy to understand the concepts of the Angular FormBuilder. Knowledge of pure JavaScript decorators will make it easy to understand the syntax of Angular Components, Services, etc.
### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
We are using Visual Studio Code during the live coding sessions. You are off-course free to use the IDE of your likings, but for a smooth, and similar experience we do recommend using Visual Studio Code. IDE TypeScript support is mandatory. Visual Studio Code can be [downloaded here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
We are going to use Node.js to run a small development server on localhost, and the Node Package Manager (NPM). [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and make sure to re-open your terminal after installation.
